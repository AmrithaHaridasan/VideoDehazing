Towards Robust Video-Dehazing: On the efficiency of SOTA models on the REVIDE dataset
##Objective
- Training of multiple SOTA models like AOD-Net, FFA-Net, Dehaze-Former on the REVIDE dataset
- Comparison of these modelsâ€™ performance on the datasets they were originally trained on56
and the REVIDE dataset
- Development of a pipeline that can deconstruct videos into images, perform dehazing58
and reconstruct dehazed images into videos
